# 🕹️ Unity Learning Journey 🎮

Welcome to my Unity learning repository! This is where I document my journey from dragging cubes into a scene to (hopefully) building the next indie masterpiece that crashes less than twice per minute. 🚧✨

## About This Repository

This is a chaotic collection of tutorials, experiments, and "what happens if I do *this*" moments — all part of my path to mastering Unity. Expect floating objects, missing colliders, and some C# scripts that probably defy the laws of physics (and logic). But hey — progress, not perfection!

## What's Inside?

- 🎲 Basic Unity scenes (a.k.a. CubeWorld)
- 💾 Scripts that may or may not compile
- 🧠 Experiments with physics, lighting, and things I don’t fully understand yet
- 🕹️ My first games! (Some are playable, some are... art)
- 🧩 Assets I’ve added and forgotten why

---

## Current State

Let’s just say: **stuff works when it wants to.** You might find:

- Objects randomly flying into space 🌌  
- Rigidbodies doing their own thing  
- UIs that appear in mysterious dimensions  
- One script named `GameManager.cs` that's doing *way* too much

## Learning Progress

- ✅ Installed Unity without breaking my PC  
- ✅ Dragged a cube into the scene (feeling powerful)  
- ✅ Learned what a prefab is (kinda)  
- ✅ Made something move... unintentionally  
- 🔄 Still wrestling with Unity’s input system  
- 🏗️ On the way to understanding the ECS system (pray for me)  
- 🌟 Future goal: Make something cool and not break the build

## Disclaimer

If you're a Unity pro who stumbled here, please keep in mind: I'm like a raccoon discovering a keyboard. Curious, chaotic, and sometimes accidentally impressive. 🦝💻

## Fun Fact

Unity’s console is my most loyal companion. It never lies. It just throws errors with cryptic messages that send me on hours-long debugging quests. 🔍🐛

## Final Thought

Every legendary developer once started by rotating a cube. I'm just out here rotating mine — badly — but with enthusiasm. 🚀  
Let’s see where this madness goes!
